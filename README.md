# Queer NLP Paper Repository
This repository collects papers that sit at the intersection between the queer community and natural language processing. It is sorted by tasks, and a single paper can appear in multiple sections. Tasks are presented in alphabetical order and papers are presented in chronological order. 

This repository does not contain:
- papers from outside of NLP (e.g. linguistics, sociology, gender studies, ...)
- papers that don't explicitly mention the queer community or subsets of the queer community

If you want a paper to be added to this repository, you can make a pull request or submit it via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpZxc6V5OgS77hy08qt3iuA1vOdqkvCuQ74xRSGJ6Hjs7zAw/viewform?usp=header"><u>this google form</u></a> .
