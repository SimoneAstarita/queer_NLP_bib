# Queer NLP Paper Repository
This repository collects papers that sit at the intersection between the queer community and natural language processing. It is sorted by tasks, and a single paper can appear in multiple sections. Tasks are presented in alphabetical order and papers are presented in chronological order. 

This repository does not contain:
- papers from outside of NLP (e.g. linguistics, sociology, gender studies, ...)
- papers that don't explicityl mention the queer community or subsets of the queer community
